## Aim:
The aim of this experiment is to apply heuristic evaluation of existing websites or apps and redesign them by combining features of two competing applications to improve the overall user experience.
## Algorithm:
1.Start.

2.Select 2 existing apps/websites to analyse (e.g Whatsapp,Telegram).

3.Apply heuristic evaluation to each app (check usability, design, navigation, etc.).

4.Note strengths and weaknesses of each app.

5.Decide which features to combine or improve.

6.Create a prototype or sketch for the new app using the chosen features.

7.Test the new design with users or peers to get feedback.

8.Refine the design based on feedback.

9.End.

## Heuristic Evaluation: WhatsApp vs. Telegram

# 1. Visibility of System Status

WhatsApp: Excellent. Provides clear feedback through a single checkmark (sent), a double checkmark (delivered), and blue checkmarks (read). Shows "typing..." and "recording..." indicators.


Telegram: Excellent. Uses a single checkmark for "sent," a double checkmark for "read," and a "typing..." indicator. The cloud-based nature also means the status of message synchronization is seamless and almost always instantaneous.

# 2. Match Between System and the Real World

WhatsApp: Very good. Uses universally understood icons and language (e.g., a phone icon for calls, a paperclip for attachments). Its interface closely mimics a real-world conversation.

Telegram: Very good. Also uses familiar metaphors. Its channel and group features are organized in a way that matches real-world communities and broadcast models.

# 3. User Control and Freedom

WhatsApp: Good. Users can delete messages, but only within a certain time frame. Deleting a message "for everyone" also leaves a visible "this message was deleted" note.


Telegram: Excellent. Offers greater control. Users can delete messages for both themselves and the other party at any time, even long after they were sent. Messages can also be edited after being sent, providing more flexibility.


# 4. Consistency and Standards

WhatsApp: Excellent. The interface is highly consistent across iOS, Android, and desktop, following platform conventions and its own internal standards. The user experience is predictable.

Telegram: Good. While it maintains consistency, the sheer number of features, custom themes, and bots can sometimes make the user experience less uniform, as the appearance can vary widely based on user customization.

# 5. Error Prevention

WhatsApp: Good. As a simple app, there are fewer opportunities for user error. Common actions like deleting chats require a confirmation step.

Telegram: Good. Prevents common errors with clear warnings (e.g., when joining a group). However, the complexity of bots and advanced features means users can sometimes make mistakes in commands or settings.

# 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall

WhatsApp: Excellent. Its simple feature set means users don't need to remember complex commands. All actions are visible and accessible through icons and menus.

Telegram: Good. Most features are discoverable, but due to its vast functionality (e.g., finding a specific bot's command or a less-used setting), some level of recall is occasionally required.

# 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

WhatsApp: Good for simplicity. It is highly efficient for basic communication and its streamlined interface makes it quick for everyday use.


Telegram: Excellent for power users. Features like chat folders, the ability to search across all chats (cloud-based), and a rich bot ecosystem make it incredibly flexible and efficient for managing large volumes of information and automating tasks.

# 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

WhatsApp: Excellent. It has a clean, minimalist design focused on the core chat function. The interface is not cluttered with unnecessary features.

Telegram: Good. The default design is clean, but it is less minimalist than WhatsApp due to its many features and options. The presence of bots, channels, and other elements can make the main screen feel more complex.

# 9. Help and Documentation

WhatsApp: Good. Has a comprehensive FAQ section and in-app support for common issues.

Telegram: Excellent. Has a detailed and user-friendly FAQ. The in-app bot @Botfather and other help bots are integral to the user experience, providing a quick and easy way to get help with specific features.

# 10. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

## WhatsApp: 
Good. Displays clear error messages like "message failed to send" or "waiting for message." The system status indicators (checkmarks) also serve this function.

## Telegram: 
Good. Displays clear error messages. The cloud-based nature means network-related errors are less common than with WhatsApp's device-based messaging.
